#Prisoner Chess Board Puzzle
#Problem Summary
A jailor presents a puzzle to two prisoners.  The jailor has an 8x8 chess board and randomly puts a coin on each square either heads up or tails up.  The jailor then brings the first prisoner into the room and points at a square.  The prisoner must flip over a single coin.  Then, the jailor brings in the second prisoner who must determine which square the jailor was pointing at.  The two prisoners can discuss a strategy before they attempt the puzzle, but there can be no communication once the puzzle has begun.
